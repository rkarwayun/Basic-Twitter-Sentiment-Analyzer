# Basic-Twitter-Sentiment-Analyzer

This project uses TextBlob and Tweepy libraries to analyze sentiments of tweets. User inputs the search word and the number of tweets that they want to analyze and the output (tweets and sentiment as positive or negative) is written to a CSV file.

This code is based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_OZdbCzHUA) by Siraj Raval.
